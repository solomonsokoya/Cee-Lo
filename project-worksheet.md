-User will be alerted who won

### Game Reset
How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.

-There will be a reset button and it will reset by itself.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Component 1 | H | 10hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |
| Shuffle of Dice Function| H | 2hrs |
| Store Players Roll and  Compare| H | 3hrs| 
| Animatiion of Dice | H | 4hrs |
| Landing Page (Using Form) | 2 hrs |
| CSS Styling | L | 4hrs - 6hrs |


## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project.
